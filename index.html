              It twas the day before birth, on this here mother earth.
              <br /><br />Cobi was getting ready to make his escape, for he had
              a doctor's appointment, and did not want to be late.<br /><br />Meanwhile
              a father and an older sister to be, waited in the waiting room,
              for the brand new baby.

              After a scream and a shout, the mother had finally pushed that
              baby boy out. <br /><br />
              While it was the most beautiful thing the mother and father had
              ever seen. <br /><br />
              Older sister Celeste, looked as if she had a pain in her chest.
              <br /><br />
              And so the tale of the two began, stories the parents would tell
              over and over again.

              I'm a monster and I'm hungry our babysitter proclaimed... "No! Eat
              Cobi first" said Celeste without shame... <br /><br />
              "Dad... Cobi's not in the back of the car", knowing full well
              before leaving, but waited to tell until they were a far.
              <br /><br />
              With a wedgie here and a wet willy there, Celeste gave Cobi plenty
              of ripped undies to wear. <br /><br />
              As the two grew older, Celeste's mischievous ways had only gotten
              bolder.

              When rafting at the Kern river, Celeste chose to let Cobi fall in
              and shiver. <br /><br />
              After a hard day's work Cobi just liked to go to sleep, but upon
              hopping into bed, found numerous toy animals underneath his
              sheets. <br /><br />So Cobi has come to realize after 27 years
              later, what to expect from his older sister's behavior. <br><br>Happy 31st birthday, <br>
